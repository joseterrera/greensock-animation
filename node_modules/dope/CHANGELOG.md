# Changes
## [2.2.0](../../commit/7d9e787029a68e50893009424b7c4ae31717491c) (2013-04-06)
- Remove [undocumented 2nd param](../../commit/7d9e787029a68e50893009424b7c4ae31717491c) from `dope.parse()`.

## [2.1.0](../../commit/1ddc1d2f8510e482c2c4bf5e71959c65388e4b17#dope.js) (2013-01-08)
- Add `dope.parseJSON()` method for jQuery-compatible JSON-parsing syntax.
- Remove `dope.bridge()` in favor of integration by other means, e.g. `dj.bridge()` or `ender.ender()` or `jQuery.extend()`.

## [2.0.0](../../commit/4398e2cf62c9618633ae765f457654592cb6f958#dope.js) (2012-09-18)
- Reorganized and improved much of the underlying code.
- Removed wrapper function. `dope` is now an `"object"`. It still contains an `.fn` methods usable via `.call` or via integration.
- Integration is no longer automatic—the bridge must be explicitly called: `dope.bridge(jQuery)`
- Top-level dataset/attr methods are made "fast and simple" while the `.fn` versions remain "full-feature" for collections.
- When setting attributes, the top-level `dope.dataset()` now returns the current value. (In v1.x it returned the element.)
- Added "func arg" capabilities.
- Renamed `dope.render()` to `dope.parse()` and added option to parse JSON.
- Added `dope.attr()`/`dope.removeAttr()`/`dope.queryAttr()`
- Added general purpose `dope.trim()` and `dope.map()` (to replace mapFilter)
- Removed `dope.toDataSelector()`/`dope.noConflict()`/`dope.toArray()`/`dope.mapFilter`
